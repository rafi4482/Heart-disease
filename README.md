## Overview

This repository contains a machine learning model built using Scikit-learn to classify whether a patient has heart disease or not based on a set of features. The model utilizes various classification algorithms and hyperparameter tuning techniques to achieve accurate predictions.

## Features

- Preprocessing of feature variables
- Implementation of multiple classification algorithms
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV
- Visualization of model evaluation metrics

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about patients including gender, age, chol,fbs and others. It's important to note that the dataset should be obtained and processed prior to using this repository.

## Model Evaluation
The trained classification models are evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV for improved model performance.

## Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 97%, precision of 99%, recall of 68%, and F1-score of 80%. This indicates that our model is effective at predicting diabetes based on the given features.
